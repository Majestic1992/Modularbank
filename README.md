### Technologies

This app uses Sass preprocessor for styling.
"react-flags-select" npm package in order to add a dropdown menu with flags and search for country selector.

### Optimisation

As the app is quite small, in order to optimise the size, no libraries were used for styling and only one additional npm package was installed (react-flags-select).
